Finance-Domain-BI-Dashboard-
Steps:

1.Extracted the data Into MySQL, created a database, and made connections between them, finally Imported data to PowerBi data sets, and ETL processes from the MySQL database - a great opportunity for me to revise the SQL commands.

2.Did Data wrangling, Data Cleaning, Data modeling, and finally created amazing Dashboards. Data modeling with snowflake scheme across > 10 tables

3.Creating more (and really a lot more) calculated measures using DAX formulas

4.Dashboarding including views for 4 different target audiences - Finance, Sales, SupplyChain, Executive (For upper management people like CEO etc)

5.Incorporating stakeholder feedback during UAT - it really took some effort to think of how and what to present given the limited real estate on a single view. Thankfully, we could make use of tooltip functionality to create supplemental views!

6.Deploying the solution via PowerBI web service

7.The first time Added a Navigation bar for all pages and Gave it a Dynamic Website look ... love this end-to-end project which involves:

One Major takeaway from the project I learned is, that it's not about the tool, it is about solving the problem.
